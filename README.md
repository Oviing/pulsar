# Using PCA, k-Means and hierachical clustering for unsupervised learning in the clustering of pulsars

## library.R
This file contains all the libraries for the analysis

## data.R
the data.R file loads the data, plots the variable dependence, creates a subset of the data and creates a color vector.

## pca.R
This file contains all the commands to perform a principal component analysis. As well functions for plotting the result are included. results can be plotted colorized or not.

## kmeans.R
The kmeans.R file contains the commands to perform the k-Means unsupervised learning approach. The results can be plotted.
Wrong clustered points can be plotted in an extra color.

## hc.R
The hc.R file contains the commands for performing a hierachical clustering and plotting the results also in a two dimensional space.


To perform the experiment correctly it has to repeat in the following steps:
1. library.R
2. data.R
3. pca.R
4. kmeans.R
5  hc.R
